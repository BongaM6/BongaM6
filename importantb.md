What is more important: rushing to complete as many cards as possible? Or making sure you fully understand the work? And Why?

Making sure you fully understand is important so that you know the work and can perform tasks. Understanding is important
also because  you can identify you own gaps, seek clarity and develop or improve your skills. You become better 
knowledgeable and well equipped.
